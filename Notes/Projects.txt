1. First Blog App:

        mkdir Blog App
        cd Blog App
        create-react-app blog
        cd blog
        npm start OR sudo npm start
        
        Go to; https://startbootstrap.com/themes/
             Select the "Clean Blog" Template; https://startbootstrap.com/previews/clean-blog/
             download it on your pc
        
        Extract the template, copy everything to your blog folder under public directory, except "index.html" file
        On the index.html of original template;
            copy the bootstrap/css fonts to your index.html file header,
            copy the jQuery section of the body to and paste it too in the same current index.html file.
            Now, copy the body upto the footer section and paste it into the src/app.js inside the "<div> tag </div>"
            Do this while regarding the JSX Syntax
            Change the "class" keyword to "className" on the div tags
       Link for changing correct/valid "Anchor-tag" in  Reactjs;
                                https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/master/docs/rules/anchor-is-valid.md
            change the index.html, css path to "css/clean-blog.css" in order to add style for the header bg image
            Under src, create a new folder named "Navbar.js" , cut the navbar section from App.js,
            and paste it inside the later navbar component
            Repeat the same steps for Header, Container and footer too
            But on the Container component, try to inject the "post-preview" class, inside it and place it on its own component

        Read on ES6 Documentation of "map function"
        Inside Coursesales.js, create another component "Course"  (should be moved to its own component)
