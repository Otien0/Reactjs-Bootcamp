1. First Blog App:

        mkdir Blog App
        cd Blog App
        create-react-app blog
        cd blog
        npm start OR sudo npm start
        
        Go to; https://startbootstrap.com/themes/
             Select the "Clean Blog" Template; https://startbootstrap.com/previews/clean-blog/
             download it on your pc
        
        Extract the template, copy everything to your blog folder under public directory, except "index.html" file
        On the index.html of original template;
            copy the bootstrap/css fonts to your index.html file header,
            copy the jQuery section of the body to and paste it too in the same current index.html file.
            Now, copy the body upto the footer section and paste it into the src/app.js inside the "<div> tag </div>"
            Do this while regarding the JSX Syntax
            Change the "class" keyword to "className" on the div tags
       Link for changing correct/valid "Anchor-tag" in  Reactjs;
                                https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/master/docs/rules/anchor-is-valid.md
                  instead, use <a href="/#" > on the anchor tag to avoid problems.
            change the index.html, css path to "css/clean-blog.css" in order to add style for the header bg image
            Under src, create a new folder named "Navbar.js" , cut the navbar section from App.js,
            and paste it inside the later navbar component
            Repeat the same steps for Header, Container and footer too
            But on the Container component, try to inject the "post-preview" class, inside it and place it on its own component

        edit the App.css file for the <span> tag for the Timer
        Check on this site-documentation for Dates in JavaScript:
                                        https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date

                                        props validation
                                        constructor, and
                                        time-interval.

        create-react-app course-purchase
        cd course-purchase
        npm start OR sudo npm start
        
        Create a new Component, "Coursesales.js"
        Read on ES6 Documentation of "map function"
        Inside Coursesales.js, create another component "Course"  (should be moved to its own component)
        
        This is just a simple react app that;
                       Display the list of available courses,
                       Users can select number of courses as it diplays their total amount,

          Go to firebase console, Database/Rules and modify it(from !=null to ===null) to allow users to interact the data.(THIS
          IS NOT RECOMENDED/NOT A GOOD PRACTISE). 
          Again, add firebase to your web app, copy the config{
                                                              var firebaseConfig = {

                                                              measurementId: "G-REJNVNGS3J" 
                                                              };
                                                              firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
                                                              firebase.analytics();
           and paste it into your Survey Component App.
         
         On Connecting to the database, ensure you modify the rules(Which is not necessarily a good thing to do), 
         then go to "Realtime Database, then create a new database.
         After submitting the data, the new database will be created.
         That's it You're done!
         TODO: Change some styles in css...submit button, make it lining with the theme.
         
9. Firebase Login App:
         mkdir Firebase Login App
         cd Firebase Login App
         create-react-app firebase-login
         cd firebase-login
         npm start OR sudo npm start OR yarn start
         
         This is a simple react.js app for authentication through firebase, with sign-up, login, and logout.
         
         Install firebase as a package;
                                       npm install --save firebase
                In case of npm installation error, clear your npm cache by the following command:
                                                              npm cache clean --force
                                                              then npm i --save firebase-admin

        Now;                                      
         Set-Up your firebase through this link:
                                                 https://console.firebase.google.com/    >>then;
         Create new project- "Your app name", i.e; firebase-login
         Go to firebase console, Realtime Database, then create new database, next go to Rules and modify
         it(to "Auth != null, for both read/write) to allow only authorized users to interact the data.
         Again go to Authentication, then sign-in method, ensure the "email/password" is set to enabled.
          
         Check out on JavaScript, ES6 Promises:

         NOTE: While removing the entries in the database, make sure to be deleting in the Authentication side too.
         The documentation for the new firebase update can be found at:
                                                                       https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/password-auth
         Adding Google Authentication;
         Again go to Authentication, then sign-in method, ensure the "Google" is set to enabled, and click Save.
          This for same project or a new one if in-case.
         Google sign-in documantation link: https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/google-signin
         Here you can try both methods;
                                       1. sign in with a pop-up window,
                                       2. sign in by redirecting to the sign-in page.
                                       
         That's it, the App is now complete.
