1. First Blog App:

        mkdir Blog App
        cd Blog App
        create-react-app blog
        cd blog
        npm start OR sudo npm start
        
        Go to; https://startbootstrap.com/themes/
             Select the "Clean Blog" Template; https://startbootstrap.com/previews/clean-blog/
             download it on your pc
        
        Extract the template, copy everything to your blog folder under public directory, except "index.html" file
        On the index.html of original template;
            copy the bootstrap/css fonts to your index.html file header,
            copy the jQuery section of the body to and paste it too in the same current index.html file.
            Now, copy the body upto the footer section and paste it into the src/app.js inside the "<div> tag </div>"
            Do this while regarding the JSX Syntax
            Change the "class" keyword to "className" on the div tags
       Link for changing correct/valid "Anchor-tag" in  Reactjs;
                                https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/master/docs/rules/anchor-is-valid.md
            change the index.html, css path to "css/clean-blog.css" in order to add style for the header bg image
            Under src, create a new folder named "Navbar.js" , cut the navbar section from App.js,
            and paste it inside the later navbar component
            Repeat the same steps for Header, Container and footer too
            But on the Container component, try to inject the "post-preview" class, inside it and place it on its own component
            
            
2. Timer App:
        mkdir Timer App
        cd Timer App
        create-react-app stop-watch
        cd stop-watch
        npm start OR sudo npm start
        
        On src, create a new Component file "Timer.js"
        edit the App.css file for the <span> tag for the Timer
        Check on this site-documentation for Dates in JavaScript:
                                        https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
        This app tests basically on Reacts;
                                        Componets methods
                                        props validation
                                        constructor, and
                                        time-interval.
                                        
3. Course-Sales App:
        mkdir Course-Sales App
        cd Course-Sales App
        create-react-app course-purchase
        cd course-purchase
        npm start OR sudo npm start
        
        Create a new Component, "Coursesales.js"
        Read on ES6 Documentation of "map function"
        Inside Coursesales.js, create another component "Course"  (should be moved to its own component)
        
        This is just a simple react app that;
                       Display the list of available courses,
                       Users can select number of courses as it diplays their total amount,
                       To de-select a course, you double click it or reselect it again and the
                       total amount too will be displayed.
