            copy the bootstrap/css fonts to your index.html file header,
            copy the jQuery section of the body to and paste it too in the same current index.html file.
            Now, copy the body upto the footer section and paste it into the src/app.js inside the "<div> tag </div>"
            Do this while regarding the JSX Syntax
            Change the "class" keyword to "className" on the div tags
